# Preliminary-Design-of-Turboprop-Aircraft
Conducted design point estimation for regional turboprop aircraft
This project focuses on the Preliminary Design of a Regional Transport Aircraft (RTA), combining aerodynamics, structural analysis, and performance optimization to meet mission specifications. Key highlights include:

1. Conceptual Design Validation: Estimation of the design point using performance sizing and constraint analysis.
2. Maximum Takeoff Weight (MTOW): Calculations refined for payload and engine efficiency.
3. Wing Design: Selection of NACA 64-108 airfoil and creation of a 3D wing model for enhanced lift and stability.
4. Structural Analysis: Evaluation of deformation, safety margins, and load factors under operational stresses.
5. Aerodynamic Optimization: Determination of wing loading and power loading for superior performance.
6. Engine Selection: Matching engine power requirements to mission parameters for optimal thrust.
7. Material Selection: Use of aluminum alloy for strength, durability, and weight efficiency.
8. Computational Methods: Utilized simulation tools to analyze and validate design outputs.
9. Mission Scope: Focused on RTAs connecting regional hubs with efficient, cost-effective solutions.
This repository offers insights into design methodologies, supporting calculations, and analysis outputs.
